SCHS Running
by Christian Ochoa [CalOchoa@gmail.com]

A website designed to allow current and past athletes from Santa Clara High school to view their running-related accomplishments. The site is also meant to preserve the history of running records and achievements set by Santa Clara High school students. Furthermore, the site will be used as a reference for a variety of workouts, health, and fitness related content. Hopefully, with enough information, I'll also be able to perform statistical analysis across the large set of data to track athlete's progress throughout the season and better train them as their running coach.
